/*  "Make Avg":-

You are given 2 integers - A and C.You need to find if there exists an integer B which meets the following condition:
B must be an integer.
B is the average of A and C.


"Input Format":-
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers A and C, the given integers.

"Output Format"
For each test case, output âˆ’1 if there exists no integer B which is the average of A and C. Else, output the value of B.
