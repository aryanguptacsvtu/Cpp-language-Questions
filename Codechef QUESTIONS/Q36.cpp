/*     "Passing Marks":-

In a class of N students, a class test was held. The ith student scored Ai marks. It is also known that the scores of all students were distinct.
A student passes the test if their score is strictly greater than the passing mark. Given that exactly X students pass in the test, find the maximum value of the passing mark of the test.


"Input Format":-
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and X â€” the number of students in the class and the number of students that passed in the test.
The next line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2...An, where the ith integer denotes the marks of the ith student.

"Output Format":-
For each test case, output on a new line, the maximum value of the passing mark of the test.*/
